# helium-client-1.8
An old 1.8.8 hacked client by Shotbowxd, dotexe and Kansio. This version contains my original client base, Click GUI, and HUD design.

# How to build
Use mcp918 and add all of the libraries from libs.zip into your project's build path settings. You should be able to just export as a .jar in eclipse and manually copy in the assets from Minecraft 1.8.8, and compiled libs from libs.zip into the .jar file with 7-Zip/WinRAR.
