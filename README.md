# helium-client-1.8
An old 1.8.8 hacked client by Shotbowxd, dotexe and Kansio. This version contains my original client base, Click GUI, and HUD design.

# How to build
Update: Compiling this thing is like a dark art. I wrote some instructions below but I tried them and they don't even work. There is some bug with ViaMCP being case sensitive and using two different cases, so you need a file manager that can work in case sensitive mode on jar files to fix that. Even after fixing it, it still doesn't work sometimes. >:V

Use mcp918 and add all of the libraries from libs.zip into your project's build path settings. You should be able to just export as a .jar in eclipse and manually copy in the assets from Minecraft 1.8.8, and compiled libs from libs.zip into the .jar file with 7-Zip/WinRAR.
